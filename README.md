# Application for restaurant business

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I present the application that we have developed as a final degree project (TFG), specifically the higher degree of web application development. The development of the project has been carried out in group, formed by 2 members. My partner **Marcos Cachafeiro Silva** and my person **Diego Castiblanque Alberca** have formed the group. 

The project has been developed with technologies like:
- **React 18 + Vite** 
- **Laravel 10**. 

We have also used technologies like AWS, Apache, NPM, GIT, etc. 

The programming languages used for the development have been **JavaScript** for the frontend and **PHP 8** for the backend. 

The application is based on a SPA (Single Page Application) + API Rest. 

I also leave a link that will take you to the web application, which is deployed on AWS:
