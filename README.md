Here I present the application that we present as a final degree project (TFG), specifically the higher degree of web application development. The development of the project has been carried out in group, formed by 2 members. My partner Marcos Cachafeiro Silva and my person Diego Castiblanque Alberca have formed the group. 

The project has been developed with technologies like React 18 + Vite 5 and Laravel 10. We have also used technologies like AWS, Apache, NPM, GIT, etc. 

The programming languages used for the development have been JavaScript for the frontend and PHP for the backend. 

The application is based on a SPA (Single Page Application) + API Rest. 

I also leave a link that will take you to the web portal, which is deployed on AWS (Due to the cost of services, the server may not be active).
